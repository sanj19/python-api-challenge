The goal of this project was to develop a website to present results from the Global Weather Data Analysis project. Since the completed project files were available in a GitHub repository, the necessary data and visualizations were imported directly from that location. HTML with Bootstrap CSS was used to generate, format, and link the individual webpages to form the completed website.

Questions
Develop a webpage presenting a summary of the project and the four associated visualizations.
Develop four webpages each presenting an individual visualization along with its associated analysis.
Develop a webpage presenting a comparison of the four visualizations.
Develop a webpage presenting a table of the raw data used to create the four visualizations.
